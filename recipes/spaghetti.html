<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>To make spaghetti with tomato sauce, start by preparing the sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled and halved garlic clove, so you can remove the core and make the scent more delicate. Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes and salt</li>
    <li>Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low heat: the sauce should simmer gently. Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic and pass the tomatoes through a sieve to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree</li>
    <li>Pour the sauce back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and add the basil leaves. After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water</li>
    <li>Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce and stir for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together. Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste!</li>
